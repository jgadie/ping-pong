# _{Ping Pong with Jasmine G!}_

#### _{A light game of Ping Pong}, {3.10.18}_

#### By _**{Jasmine Gadie**_

## Description
```
_{This is a practice game of Ping Pong that I am creating for a class assignment.  Ping Pong is also known as Table Tennis.  This is _kinda_like that. In this game, if you enter a number divisible by 3, the page should generate the result, "ping".  If you enter a number divisible by 5, the page should generate the result, "pong".  And, if you enter a number divisible by 15, the page should generate the result, "Ping Pong!".  How fun is that?  Enjoy ;)}_
```
## Specifications
```
Enter a number divisible by 3:
* Example Input: 3
* Example Output: [3, 6, 9]

Enter a number divisible by 5:
* Example Input: 5
* Example Output: [5, 10, 15]

Enter a number divisible by 15:
* Example Input: 15
* Example Output: [15, 30, 45]

```

## Setup/Installation Requirements
```
* Clone ping-pong repository from Jasmine's Github
* Open the ping-pong folder
* Open the ping-pong.html

_{If you are not able to open the ping-pong.html in the ping-pong folder, right click on the ping-pong.html and open in the web browser of your choice.}_
```
## Known Bugs
```
_{Basically, the entire webpage is a bug.  The code I have so far runs in the console without an error.  However, the page does not run as the Specifications say it should.  The only way to generate ping, Pong, or Ping-Pong, is to enter all the values at the same time and press the submit button.  Otherwise, the script will not run.  I am currently stuck on this assignment since I am unable to make the page respond as the Specifications have outlined.}_
