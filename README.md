# _{Ping Pong with Jasmine G!}_

#### _{A light game of Ping Pong}, {3.10.18}_

#### By _**{Jasmine Gadie**_

## Description
```
_{This is a practice game of Ping Pong that I am creating for a class assignment.  Ping Pong is also known as Table Tennis.  This is _kinda_like that. In this game, if you enter a number divisible by 3, the page should generate the result, "ping".  If you enter a number divisible by 5, the page should generate the result, "pong".  And, if you enter a number divisible by 15, the page should generate the result, "Ping Pong!".  How fun is that?  Enjoy ;)}_
```
